Ethereum Network Stats
============
[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![dependency status][dep-image]][dep-url]

This is a visual interface for tracking ethereum network status. It uses WebSockets to receive stats from running nodes and output them through an angular interface. It is the front-end implementation for [eth-net-intelligence-api](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api).

## Prerequisite
* node
* npm

## Installation
Make sure you have node.js and npm installed.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oraclesorg/eth-netstats
cd eth-netstats
npm install
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Configuration
In order to configure the connection between the Dashboard with the [POA Backend](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-netstats-warehouse) you must to set the `BACKEND_SECRET` and `BACKEND_URL` environment variables or create the `backend_var.json` file in the root folder (see `backend_var.example.json` file).
- `BACKEND_SECRET` is the secret in order to connect with the Websocket exposed by the POA Backend
- `BACKEND_URL` is the url where the backend is listening for incoming WebSocket connections

## Build the resources
NetStats features two versions: the full version and the lite version. In order to build the static files you have to run grunt tasks which will generate dist or dist-lite directories containing the js and css files, fonts and images.


To build the full version run
```bash
grunt
```

To build the lite version run
```bash
grunt lite
```

If you want to build both versions run
```bash
grunt all
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```
